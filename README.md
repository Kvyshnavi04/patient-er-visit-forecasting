This project develops a machine learning model to predict whether a patient is likely to visit the Emergency Room using historical medical records and time-based health patterns.

Patient data is preprocessed and enhanced through feature engineering, capturing indicators such as previous visit frequency and chronic health conditions. An XGBoost classifier is trained to identify high-risk patients with improved predictive performance.

The system is designed to support proactive healthcare planning, helping providers reduce emergency overload and improve patient care through data-driven decision-making.
